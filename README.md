## Efficient-Deep-Learning-for-Point-Clouds
This project is about designing efficient 3-d point cloud Deep Neural Networks with pure algorithm (software-level) optimizations. Our techniques 1). reduce redundant computation to achieve workload efficiency; 2). expose parallelism that can be easily captured by the underlying hardware.

### Optimized Networks

- [PointNet++]()
- [DGCNN]()
- [F-PointNet]()
