## Efficient-Deep-Learning-for-Point-Clouds
This project is about designing efficient 3-d point cloud Deep Neural Networks with pure algorithm (software-level) optimizations. Our techniques 1). reduce redundant computation to achieve workload efficiency; 2). expose parallelism that can be easily captured by the underlying hardware.

### Optimized Networks
We have applied the optimizations to the networks below:

- PointNet++: [Classification - Optimized Version](https://github.com/horizon-research/Efficient-Deep-Learning-for-Point-Clouds/tree/master/Networks/pointnet2), Segmentation - Optimized Version
- DGCNN: [Classification - Optimized Version](), Segmentation - Optimized Version
- F-PointNet: [](),
