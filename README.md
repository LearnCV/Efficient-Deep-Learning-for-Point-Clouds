## Efficient-Deep-Learning-for-Point-Clouds
This project contains algorithm optimizations for 3-d point cloud Deep Neural Networks. The goal is to improve the efficiency (speed, energy/power consumption). With that said, the key optmizations introduce parallelism in compute and reduces compute workload.
